  Here are some times for converting alldec.ref (2608 records) from refer
to bibtex.  This used bp-0.1.1 and Perl5.001.  bp-0.2.0 is about 20% faster.

Assuming alldec.ref is in the ref directory:

  time ../bin/tconv.pl -convert alldec.ref -to foo.bib -format=refer,bibtex

  It is interesting to note that there was almost no gain from overclocking
the 133 MHz Pentium machine to 180 MHz.  This same machine benefits greatly
from overclocking on many other tests, so we're guessing it's memory bound.
The SPARC machines do quite well, and the HP's do very poorly.  This may
be caused by a bad compilation of Perl on the HPs.  The Pentium Pro machines
do extremely well.
