This directory contains an example Makefile and supporting files to create
a website from BibTeX files via bibtex2web.  (You can see the result of
running the Makefile at http://pag.csail.mit.edu/pubs/.)

In order to make your own website from BibTeX files:
 1. Set your BPHOME environment variable to the lib directory of the
    unpacked distribution.  For example, if you use csh or tcsh, add
       setenv BPHOME /home/jruser/bibtex2web/lib
    to your .cshrc (with the target directory appropriately modified).
    You may need to log out and log back in for this to take effect.
 2. Copy all the files in this directory to a directory where you would
    like to create a bibliography website.
 3. Update the definition of BIBFILES in the Makefile.
    If you wish to use the html-update-toc script, which is referenced by the
    Makefile, you can obtain it at
    http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mernst/software/#html-update
 4. Run make
 5. After examining the output, you may wish to customize some of the
    template files that you copied from the bibtex2web directory, which
    will customize the HTML files that get created.
