# load_format safely loads a format.  It calls goterror if it can't find the
# format, and returns that result (undef).  Be sure to check the result!  It
# is not meant for users to call (although it doesn't hurt anything).
#
# It also loads a character set -- either the default for the format, or one
# asked for by name.
#
# It returns an array of two values:
#    the format name, appropriate for use with the formats array
#    the cset name, for use with the charsets array
#
# Thus, load_format will find, say "myRefer" and return "refer" if that is
# how the format is installed.
#
#  XXXXX Should we install them as the name they gave us, or the format's name?
#  XXXXX How about changing this so we can load formats like:
#         '/usr/local/lib/formats/refer"
#  XXXXX Added options as "format/opt1/opt2:cset"
#        We don't support cset options, and won't until csets are 1st class.

#
# The format registry subroutine.
#
# When a format starts up, it calls this routine, which registers all its
# exported procedures to bp.  If any of the necessary functions are not
# given as arguments, they will default to the stdbib routines.  If you
# know about a stdbib routine, it is suggested that you actually call this
# using the "foo is standard" method of registering foo, so people can see
# right off that you mean it, not that you just forgot.  This also allows
# us to add functions (for example, maybe "readcanon" that reads right into
# canonical format) and then define a stdbib routine that would do the
# equivalent the long way around.  Your module continues to work, because
# the registry will see that you didn't define one, and set up the mapping.

# There are seven different formats for the function registry:
#
#   "read is standard"      registers read as the standard read routine.
#   "read"                  registers read as your function of the same name.
#   "read uses format"      registers read as format's read.
#   "read as myread"        registers read as your function named "myread".
#   "read as pkg'myread"    registers read as the function "pkg'myread".
#   "read is unsupported"   registers read as an unsupported function.
#   "read is unimplemented" registers read as an unimplemented function.
#
# Examples:
#  "write is standard"
#        Our format is going to use the standard write function, which prints
#        the record with a single empty line after it.
#  "read"
#        Our format has it's own read function, declared with "sub read".
#  "read uses refer"
#        Our format will use whatever read function the refer format uses to
#        do its reading.  This will also take care of loading the refer format
#        for you.  Use this style when your format has a lot of similarities
#        to one particular format.  Don't use it otherwise, as it would waste
#        time and memory loading a format that isn't needed.
#  "read as lukea"
#        Just in case you like naming your functions in Finnish, for example.
#  "read as bp_refer'read"
#        Not really recommended, but this lets you give the full name of the
#        function you want called.
#  "read is unsupported"
#        This makes it explicit to anyone looking at your module code that
#        you purposely do not support this function.  It sets any call to
#        this routine to code that returns an error message about the
#        procedure not being supported.
#  "read is unimplemented"
#        This makes it explicit to anyone looking at your module code that
#        you have not finished coding this function.  Similarly to the
#        unsupported option, this produces an error message about the procedure
#        having not yet been implemented.
#
# For the unsupported and unimplemented calls, you may also wish to define
# your own call that does the same thing but gives more information.
#

# On success, we return 1.  If we couldn't parse your strings, or one of the
# functions given doesn't exist, we return undef.  Your format should return
# undef if you are unable to register yourself.
