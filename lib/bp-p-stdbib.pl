# Standard routines bibliography functions.  If a format doesn't register
# its own function, this is what gets used.  It could also specifically
# request one of these functions.
#
# open, close, write, and clear are pretty generic, and I expect
# that a lot of formats will just use these.
#
# read is a little bit more complicated, so may be specifically implemented
# in a lot of formats.
#
# explode, implode, tocanon, and fromcanon are empty functions that return
# an 'unsupported' error.
#
# NOTE that these functions are not meant to be exported -- i.e. you should
# not be referring to these anywhere.  They should be put in place by the
# format registry process.

# We can expect that the variable $bib::glb_current_fmt has the name of the
# format in it.  I suppose we could alternatively pass it in to every
# function, but that's pretty ugly, and a lot of routines don't need to know
# that.  After all, inside format code you should know what your own name is!
#
# We also use the variable $bib::glb_current_fh as the filehandle to use.

# XXXXX We ought to have another read routine that handles those formats
#       that have no well defined end-of-record.  So we read until we reach
#       the next beginning of record (regex stored in an assoc array by file)
#       and then save that for the next read (again by file).
#       This would be good to implement once so nobody is tempted to write
#       it themselves and do it wrong.
